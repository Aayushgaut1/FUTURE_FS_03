# The Roasted Bean – Café Website (Task 3)

A professional, responsive website for **The Roasted Bean**, a local café. Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Ready to customize with real details and pitch to a business owner.

## Live demo

- Open `index.html` in a browser, or run a simple local server (e.g. `npx serve .` or VS Code Live Server).
- For submission: host the site (e.g. GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) and add the live URL here.

## Repository

- **GitHub:** Add your repo link here after pushing (e.g. `https://github.com/yourusername/local-business-website`).

## How to run locally

1. Clone or download this project.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser, or from the project folder run:
   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```
3. Visit the URL shown (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`).

## Customization checklist

Before pitching to a real café owner, replace placeholders with their content (or keep “The Roasted Bean” as a demo):

- [ ] **Business name** – currently “The Roasted Bean”; change in header, hero, footer, and `<title>` if using a real business.
- [ ] **About** – replace with the real café’s story and a photo (placeholder: “Café interior or coffee shot”).
- [ ] **Menu / offerings** – the three cards are set for coffee, pastries, and cozy space; adjust to match their actual menu.
- [ ] **Hours & location** – update to real opening hours and address (currently 123 Main Street, etc.).
- [ ] **Contact** – real phone and email; optionally connect the form to Formspree or Netlify Forms.

## Pitch explanation (deliverable)

Use this template for your short pitch to the business owner and for submission:

---

**How this website helps the business grow**

- **Professional online presence:** The site gives The Roasted Bean (or the café you pitch to) a clear, trustworthy place to be found by new customers and to show what they offer—specialty coffee, pastries, and a cozy space.
- **Easy discovery:** Sections for About, Menu, Hours, and Contact help visitors quickly find information and decide to visit or get in touch.
- **Mobile-friendly:** The layout works on phones and tablets, so customers can look up hours, location, and contact details on the go.
- **Low maintenance:** Built with simple HTML/CSS/JS, so updates (e.g. hours, menu, contact) can be done without expensive platforms, and it can be hosted cheaply or for free (e.g. GitHub Pages). For a café, you can later add a full menu page or a link to online ordering.
